1. Currently Asset Tag and/or Serial Number is set to be required by configuration
    Set this so that checkin doesn't care which one was filled in, one of them just has to be filled in

2. Checkbox on CheckIn forms, is this asset a loaner?

3. Add a view to select all flagged as loaner

4. Person view
    List of users, are they assigned to an asset? any other stats?

5. Asset checkin, user should not be required
