# Asset Management

This project has been a way to learn PHP and the Symfony framework. It has a specific use case of managing assets/devices for an organization with the ability to collect, track and distribute those assets. I work at a public school and the initial version of this software has proven invaluable. This project is a rewrite from the ground up using the Symfony framework.

It is currently still in alpha, not every feature is done.
